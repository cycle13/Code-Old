"""Medium_Range_Forcing
Performs regridding,downscaling, bias
correction (if needed), and layering/mixing 
of data products associated with the Medium Range
forcing configuration.  Invokes methods in the
WRF_Hydro_forcing module and input parameters
that are defined in the wrf_hydro_forcing.parm
parameter/configuration file.  Logs to a log
file that is created in the same directory
from where this script is executed.
